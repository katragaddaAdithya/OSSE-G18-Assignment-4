## WeShare Library


WeShare library is a web application for university students. This application is mainly designed to provide a platform for the students to share all the relevant materials related to subjects. Students will be able to access the courses which they have registered for the respective semester and each course in the semester students will get access to reference links to textbooks (links to PDF if available online or links to online store), reference materials related to the course and other online reference. Students will also be able to add any reference links to the course, these links added by students will be reviewed and added to the course by admin or a professor. With this all the students will get a single platform for sharing materials and relevant textbooks related to their course.
# Background:
When it comes to matter of textbook and materials, students usually share these in the WhatsApp groups and other social media chatting applications. Most of the times students will not get the relevant material as the material shared in the group are not organized.  Most of the students end up with the only having 50 to 60% of material. Many universities do not have online portals and professor would share study materials or relevant textbook references to a single student in class, but they are not sure if the material is actually being shared to all the students in class. All these problems can be solved with the WeShare library, students will be able to get all the course content available and professors can share relevant material directly with the students. 

## Aims and objectives:
Our aim is to provide students a single platform for their study content. We aim to provide all the relevant materials in an organized manner and provide a platform for professor to directly share course related content with all the students.
